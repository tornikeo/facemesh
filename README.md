# Facemesh with TFJS

This repository contains code for [tfjs facemesh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/facemesh). With some modifications to make it work locally.

# Local run

- download zipfile, extract
- do `yarn install`
- do `npm run start`
- See results at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 

# Forked from
Copied over from [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/mediapipe-tensorflowjs-facemesh-demo-facetracking-forked-ishles). This implementation didn't work. I had to manually update the `<script>` tag source to `dist/index.js` for it to start working. Took me a few hours, that.
